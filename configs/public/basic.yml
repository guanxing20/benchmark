  Basic Transfer Benchmark - Simple baseline performance test for quick client comparison and CI/CD performance regression testing.

  This benchmark provides a straightforward transfer-only transaction test with multiple gas limits (15M - 90M) to establish baseline performance metrics for both Geth and Reth clients.

  Use Case: Quick client comparison, CI/CD performance regression testing, baseline performance measurement, and initial validation of client performance characteristics.
